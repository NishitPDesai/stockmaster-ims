# GitHub Authentication Setup

## Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)

GitHub no longer accepts passwords. You need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "StockMaster IMS"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)

Then use it when pushing:
```bash
git push origin main
# Username: desainishit1111@gmail.com
# Password: <paste your token here>
```

## Option 2: Use Git Credential Manager

Windows Credential Manager will prompt you:
```bash
git push origin main
# Enter username: desainishit1111@gmail.com
# Enter password: <your personal access token>
```

## Option 3: Update Remote URL with Token

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/NishitPDesai/stockmaster-ims.git
```

**Note:** The password you provided (Nishit@7129) cannot be used directly. You need a Personal Access Token from GitHub.
