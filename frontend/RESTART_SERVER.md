# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Required

## 🔄 Please Restart the Dev Server

**Vite needs to be restarted to pick up the new environment variables.**

### Steps:

1. **Stop the current dev server** (Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running)

2. **Restart it:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Refresh your browser** (or the app will auto-reload)

### After Restart:

- Mock mode will be enabled
- No more connection errors
- All data will come from mock files
- Login will work with: `admin@stockmaster.com` / `password`

---

**The `.env` file is now configured correctly!** ✅
